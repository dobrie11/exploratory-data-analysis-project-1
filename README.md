# exploratory-data-analysis-project-1

## Review criterial

-Was a valid GitHub URL containing a git repository submitted?
-Does the GitHub repository contain at least one commit beyond the original fork?
-Please examine the plot files in the GitHub repository. Do the plot files appear to be of the correct graphics file format?
-Does each plot appear correct?
-Does each set of R code appear to create the reference plot?

##Reviewing the Assignments

Keep in mind this course is about exploratory graphs, understanding the data, and developing strategies. Here's a good quote from a swirl lesson about exploratory graphs: "They help us find patterns in data and understand its properties. They suggest modeling strategies and help to debug analyses. We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results."

The rubrics should always be interpreted in that context.

As you do your evaluation, please keep an open mind and focus on the positive. The goal is not to deduct points over small deviations from the requirements or for legitimate differences in implementation styles, etc. Look for ways to give points when it's clear that the submitter has given a good faith effort to do the project, and when it's likely that they've succeeded. Most importantly, it's okay if a person did something differently from the way that you did it. The point is not to see if someone managed to match your way of doing things, but to see if someone objectively accomplished the task at hand.

To that end, keep the following things in mind:

##DO

Review the source code.
Keep an open mind and focus on the positive.â‰¤/li>
When in doubt, err on the side of giving too many points, rather than giving too few.
Ask yourself if a plot might answer a question for the person who created it.
Remember that not everyone has the same statistical background and knowledge.

##DON'T:

Deduct just because you disagree with someone's statistical methods.
Deduct just because you disagree with someone's plotting methods.
Deduct based on aesthetics.
